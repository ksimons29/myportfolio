# Design Updates Required - Portfolio Website v3

## Context
Update existing Next.js portfolio site with the following changes. Keep current tech stack (Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript, Vercel).

## Required Changes

### 1. Section Reordering
**Current:** Hero section → Cards → About section  
**Required:** Hero section → About section → Cards  
Move the "About" section to appear immediately after the hero, before the 3 profile cards.

### 2. Hero Section Height
**Current:** Blue hero section too tall  
**Required:** Reduce hero section height to 50% of current size. Make it more compact while keeping content readable.

### 3. Profile Image Size
**Current:** Profile image size is good now  
**Status:** Keep current size (centered, prominent in hero)

### 4. LLYLI Button/Element Size
**Current:** LLYLI element too small  
**Required:** Make LLYLI button/link/element 3x larger than current size. Should be much more prominent.

### 5. Spacing Between Sections
**Current:** Too much whitespace between sections  
**Required:** Reduce vertical spacing between all major sections significantly. Sections should feel connected and flow together, not isolated blocks. Tighter, more compact layout overall.

### 6. Dark Mode Behavior
**Current:** Manual toggle for dark mode  
**Required:** Remove toggle completely. Auto-enable dark mode based on system preferences using `prefers-color-scheme` media query. Should match typical OS dark mode behavior (time-based or system setting).

### 7. WhatsApp Icon
**Current:** Successfully added ✓  
**Status:** Keep as is (visible in social icons)

### 8. Profile Summary Cards
**Current:** Successfully added ✓  
**Status:** Keep cards but move them AFTER the About section (not before)

**Card 1: Discovery to Release**  
Icon: `discovery.svg` from assets/images folder  
Turned unclear requests into an agreed first release. Combined interviews, workflow and journey mapping, and a quick maturity check to separate a product problem from a capability gap. Defined outcomes, constraints, and tradeoffs, then translated that into scope and priorities the team could ship.

**Card 2: Data and AI Products with Clear Success Criteria**  
Icon: `data.svg` from assets/images folder  
Built data and AI product features from MVP to iteration. Defined success metrics and quality checks early, then used usage signals and structured feedback with domain experts to decide what to change next.

**Card 3: Delivery and Stakeholder Leadership**  
Icon: `collaboration.svg` from assets/images folder  
Kept delivery moving by making decisions explicit and ownership clear. Aligned product, engineering, and business stakeholders through tight written updates, prioritization, and unblocking, so work shipped in focused increments.

## New Layout Order
1. **Hero Section** (50% current height)
   - Profile image (centered)
   - Name: Koos Simons
   - Subtitle: Product Manager — Lisbon
   - Social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, Email, WhatsApp)
   
2. **About Section** (moved up)
   - "6 years shipping products, 3+ years in strategy & consulting"
   - Description paragraph
   - LLYLI mention (3x larger)

3. **Profile Cards** (3 cards side-by-side)
   - Discovery to Release
   - Data and AI Products
   - Delivery and Stakeholder Leadership

4. **Availability Section** (new)
   - Headline: "Open to Product Roles & Consulting"
   - Subheadline: "Looking for Senior PM opportunities in Lisbon. Also available for consulting, interim assignments, and project-based work."
   - 3 service cards (2x2 grid on mobile, 3 columns on desktop):
     * **Product Management & Strategy**
       - Full-time or interim PM/PO for teams building data products, AI tools, or internal platforms. I help teams get unstuck and ship products that work.
       - Tag: "Full-time or Interim"
     * **Data & AI Product Consulting**
       - Product strategy, roadmap development, and success metrics for analytics and AI products. I bridge business needs and technical solutions.
       - Tag: "Project-based or Retainer"
     * **Discovery & Scoping**
       - Turn unclear requests into shippable first releases. Combined interviews, workflow mapping, and maturity assessments to separate product problems from capability gaps.
       - Tag: "2-6 week engagements"
   - CTA: "Interested? Let's discuss your needs or schedule a call."

5. **Rest of content** (if any)

## Design Guidelines
- Compact hero: 50% current height
- Tight spacing between sections
- LLYLI element: 3x larger, more prominent
- Cards: keep current design, just reposition after About
- **Availability section:**
  - Clean, professional layout
  - Service cards with left border accent (similar to screenshot)
  - Cards with title, description, and tag/badge
  - CTA with clickable links ("discuss your needs" → email, "schedule a call" → calendar link)
  - Slightly lighter background to separate from other sections
- Professional, modern aesthetic

## No Stack Changes
Keep existing: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Vercel deployment.
