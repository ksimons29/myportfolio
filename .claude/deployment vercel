# Fix Vercel build failure and trigger a new deployment

## Context
Vercel production did not update because the build failed.

Error from Vercel logs:
Type error: Property "metric" is missing in type "{ company: string; project: string; description: string; }" but required in type "Example".
Command "npm run build" exited with 1.

## Goal
1. Fix the TypeScript type error so `npm run build` succeeds.
2. Commit and push to `main` to trigger a new Vercel production deployment.
3. Confirm the new deployment is successful.

## What to change
There is a TypeScript type called `Example` that requires a `metric` field.
At least one object in an `examples` array is missing `metric`.

Preferred fix:
Add `metric: "..."` to every `Example` object that is missing it.

Fallback fix:
Make `metric` optional in the `Example` type if we do not want it required.

## Steps for Claude Code

### 1. Find the failing example object
Search the codebase for one of these strings:
"Major Dutch Bank"
"GenAI Knowledge Assistant"
or search for `examples:` near the section shown in the logs.

Add a `metric` property to the object. Use a value already present in the description so we do not invent anything.

Example safe values pulled from the existing description:
"~95% answer accuracy"
"20+ security advisors"
"Delivered v1 in ~12 months"

Pick one and add it as `metric`.

### 2. Find and check the `Example` type
Search for `type Example` or `interface Example`.

Confirm it looks roughly like this:
company: string
project: string
description: string
metric: string

Now ensure every place that creates an `Example` includes `metric`.

If multiple example objects exist, add `metric` to all missing ones.

If we decide to use the fallback, change:
metric: string
to:
metric?: string

Only use this fallback if adding `metric` everywhere is undesirable.

### 3. Run local build checks
From the repo root, run:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`

If there is a lint script, also run:
`npm run lint`

The build must pass locally.

### 4. Commit and push to trigger Vercel deployment
Run:
1. `git status`
2. `git add -A`
3. `git commit -m "Fix build: add missing metric to examples"`
4. `git push origin main`

Pushing to `main` triggers a new Vercel production deployment automatically.

### 5. Verify deployment
After push:
1. Open Vercel project dashboard
2. Check Deployments
3. Confirm the latest production deployment is successful and is on the newest commit

If it still fails, copy the new error section from Vercel logs and repeat the same process.
